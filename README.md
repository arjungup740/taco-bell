Note that 2024 is misisng DC, Wisconsin, and Wyoming behavior

There's various stores we're missing in the error dict and various stores probably missing betwene 23 and 24, can go back and do a comparison

Data issues to understand
* missing most states & cities
    * do a catalog of what's missing

What we are seeking to understand
* how much more expensive is taco bell in new york vs. Charlotte? Greenville? middle of nowhere alabama?
    * what is the average and median price of a given menu item w/in a city
* what is the distribution of menu item prices within cities/MSAs vs across them?
* how have these changed since 2023?
    
Considerations to add/think about after first pass together
* pct differences below a certain threshold don't matter
* if only 1 or two restos vs. many

TODO:
* pick a couple menu items to focus on
* build state comparisons across core menu items
* city comparisons across core menu items
* pull MSA aggregations
* debug why we only have a small amount of states
